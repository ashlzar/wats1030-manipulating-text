I was frustrated using the short keys in vi.
I had my spouse reminding me, who is also a student, or I had to review the cheat sheet to connect the dots of commands keys that didn't seem intuitive like I experienced with nano.
I feel like I could like emacs as I evolve to understand the interconnectivity of web deelopment. Emacs has potential.
